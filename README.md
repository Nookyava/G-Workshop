# About
[G]Workshop was a project created to make uploading addons to the Garry's Mod Workshop easy, with everything done within
one easy to use program, instead of a multiple step process.

What this program does is grab all the information that the client has to enter, creates a .json necessary to compile the addon
into a .gma, and then publishes said .gma onto the Workshop.
