# About
[G]Workshop was a project created to make uploading addons to the Garry's Mod Workshop easy, with everything done within
one easy to use program, instead of a multiple step process.

What this program does is grab all the information that the client has to enter, creates a .json necessary to compile the addon
into a .gma, and then publishes said .gma onto the Workshop.

# Download
[Download Here](https://github.com/Nookyava/G-Workshop/releases/tag/1.0, "Release") the latest version.

# Things to note
* The current version does not include file ignoring, so make sure anything you want to upload is removed from the folder.
* This is the initial version. Any feedback/issues/ideas will be taken into consideration and implemented as well as fixed.
